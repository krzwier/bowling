*This project is a work in progress, and is a collaboration with the illustrious [@carlhauck](https://github.com/carlhauck).*

This project is an exercise in TDD, and we are following Uncle Bob's Bowling Game Kata [here](http://www.butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata).  The powerpoint slides [here](https://github.com/krzwier/bowling/blob/c0242c0496a42e74343fc60db58a925ce5e73294/bowling-game-kata.pptx) spell out the steps of the Kata in detail.

Built in React.
